# Workforce expansion

While contact tracing is routinely performed to control STDs, TB, and other communicable diseases, local health departments have limited front-line workforce \(e.g., epidemiologists, disease intervention staff, public health nurses\) to support contact tracing at the scale and pace of COVID-19. The [CDC provides resources](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/open-america/staffing.html) for training and supplementing existing staff for ongoing and surge support.

### Population-based estimates

For contact tracing to be effective, every diagnosed case must be investigated, which means the contact tracing workforce must be capable of responding quickly even during surges. [Find the number of staff you’ll need](https://preventepidemics.org/coronavirus/resources/contact-tracing-staffing-calculator/) using this calculator provided by public health organization [Resolve to Save Lives](https://resolvetosavelives.org/), and review additional estimates below.

| **Source of estimate** | **Estimated number of contact tracing staff per 100k population** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Massachusetts/Partners in Health \(initial staffing, which PIH believes will need to be increased subsequently\) | 14 |
| Johns Hopkins/Association of State and Territorial Health Officers | 30 |
| Resolve to Save Lives | 100 |
